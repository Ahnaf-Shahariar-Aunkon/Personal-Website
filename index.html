                provide more than 2 million women, men and children in 10 different countries with humanitarian aid and
                disaster

                <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a
                    flood.Families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the event of
                    disaster.
                    Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce
                    stress, worry and

                <p>Within academia there is ongoing discussion over what constitutes natural disaster or what does not.
                    Floods, which in
                    recent years have taken the world by surprise, come into the discussion too. While that is the case,
                    its impact on
                    education systems is least discussed, if ever, yet literature acknowledges floods as one of the most
                    devastating
                    disasters ever recorded in human history.</p>
